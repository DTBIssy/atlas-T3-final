# Welcome to Rock Crawlers Expeditions

Welcome to the sister company of my previous Rock and Roll Companys. **Rock Crawler Expeditions**

## Goals

With this, I strived to create a website that replicated the cool scroll animations that you find on websites like Apple or Google. Another Goal was to implement some basic animations to make the website
feel more alive and interactable. What I've done while creating this website is:

- Implement GSAP (greensock animations) with Javascript
- Refine my javascript interactivity and Web Storage capabilities
- Learned more frameworks in a short time
- Be proud of how far I've come in a year

> Mobile and Tablet Screens are currently being implemented. Will be completed on a later date
