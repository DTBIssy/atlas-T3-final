# Welcome to Rock Crawlers Expeditions

Welcome to the sister company of my previous Rock and Roll Companys. **Rock Crawler Expeditions**

## Goals

With this, I strived to create a website that replicated the cool scroll animations that you find on websites like Apple or Google. Another Goal was to implement some basic animations to make the website
feel more alive and interactable. What I've done while creating this website is:

- Implement GSAP (greensock animations) with Javascript
- Refine my javascript interactivity and Web Storage capabilities
- Learned more frameworks in a short time
- Be proud

> Mobile and Tablet Screens are currently being implemented. Will be completed on a later date

## Experience

While making this website, I can't lie, I was burnt out. It was only by forcing myself to continue through the obstacle that I came out very proud of my website and myself. It was also the fun of spending 16 hours in one day with friends who were also attempting to get their website to a presentable state. And there is really no sarcasm in that statement, I had fun and I'm proud of them as well. All in all, This project wraps up my first year through Atlas and programming, And its really hitting me at the end of the year how far I've come. This probably isn't required in my README for points but im putting it here anyway. Because I want it here.
