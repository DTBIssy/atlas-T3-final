# Welcome to Rock Crawlers Expeditions

Welcome to the sister company of my previous Rock and Roll Companys. **Rock Crawler Expeditions**

## Goals

With this website I strived to create a website that replicated the cool scroll animations you find on websites like Apple or Google. Another Goal was to implement some basic animations to make the website
feel more alive and interactable. What I've learned while creating this website:

- How to implement GSAP (greensock animations) with Javascript
- Refining my javascript interactivity and Web Storage capabilities
- And also how to push my self alittle further over the finish line

> Mobile and Tablet Screens are currently being implemented. Will be completed on a later date
